Feeling
More than perfect, amazing
More than words can explain it's
Purest form of reality
Divinity
I've been
Suffering in this tiring
Crazy world like I'm drowning
There's no way to escape I thought but
Finally here I am
I'll never find another love like this it's true
I'll never find another love like this
Baby can you feel it too just like I do
(Who does paradise belong to)
I'll never find another love like this I know
I'll never find another love like this
Baby can I give it to you
Just like you do
Then we share it too
Thank you
Wherever I go I feel you
Now I know
That I'll never love like this
Sacred
Sweet divine invitation
To heal a heart that's been breaking
Mend a soul that's been crying out
Let me out
Now I am
Falling softly colliding
Into your sweet silver lining
There's no way to escape from heaven
Finally here we are
I'll never find another love like this it's true
I'll never find another love like this
Baby can you feel it too just like I do
(Who does paradise belong to)
I'll never find another love like this I know
I'll never find another love like this
Baby can I give it to you
Just like you do
Then we share it too
Thank you
Wherever I go I feel you
Now I know
That I'll never love like this
That I'll never love like this

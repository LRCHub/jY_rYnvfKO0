We May Never Love Like This Again
Maureen McGovern

From: the film Towering Inferno

We may never love like this again
Don't stop the flow
We can't let go

We may never love like this again
And touch the sky
Now we may try

So while we here
Let's give up all
We listed the dreams Inside us
And set them free

Oh, while we here
Let's live a mark
There's a candle in the dark
It's here to guide us

We may never love like this again
But through the days
Beyond the highs
I'll see you
Reaching out to hold me
I don't know just
Where or when
Still I'm sure

We'll love again, we'll love again
We'll love again (we may never love like this again)

We'll love again (we may never love like this again)
We'll love again (we may never love like this again)

We'll love again (we may never love like this again)...
